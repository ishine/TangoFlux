## News
> 📣 1/3/25: We have released CRPO dataset as well as the script to perform CRPO dataset generation!

## Demos

[![Hugging Face Space](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugging_Face_Space-TangoFlux-blue?logo=huggingface&link=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fspaces%2Fdeclare-lab%2FTangoFlux)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/declare-lab/TangoFlux)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/declare-lab/TangoFlux/blob/main/Demo.ipynb)

## Overall Pipeline

TangoFlux consists of FluxTransformer blocks, which are Diffusion Transformers (DiT) and Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) conditioned on a textual prompt and a duration embedding to generate a 44.1kHz audio up to 30 seconds long. TangoFlux learns a rectified flow trajectory to an audio latent representation encoded by a variational autoencoder (VAE). TangoFlux training pipeline consists of three stages: pre-training, fine-tuning, and preference optimization with CRPO. CRPO, particularly, iteratively generates new synthetic data and constructs preference pairs for preference optimization using DPO loss for flow matching.

🚀 **TangoFlux can generate 44.1kHz stereo audio up to 30 seconds in ~3 seconds on a single A40 GPU.**

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/declare-lab/TangoFlux
```

## Inference

TangoFlux can generate audio up to 30 seconds long. You must pass a duration to the `model.generate` function when using the Python API. Please note that duration should be between 1 and 30.

### Web Interface

Run the following command to start the web interface:

```bash
tangoflux-demo
```

### CLI

Use the CLI to generate audio from text.

```bash
tangoflux "Hammer slowly hitting the wooden table" output.wav --duration 10 --steps 50
```

### Python API

```python
import torchaudio
from tangoflux import TangoFluxInference

model = TangoFluxInference(name='declare-lab/TangoFlux')
audio = model.generate('Hammer slowly hitting the wooden table', steps=50, duration=10)

torchaudio.save('output.wav', audio, 44100)
```

### [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)

> This ui will let you design and execute advanced stable diffusion pipelines using a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface.

Check [this](https://github.com/LucipherDev/ComfyUI-TangoFlux) repo for the TangoFlux custom node for *ComfyUI*. (Thanks to [LucipherDev](https://github.com/LucipherDev))

Our evaluation shows that inference with 50 steps yields the best results. A CFG scale of 3.5, 4, and 4.5 yield similar quality output. Inference with 25 steps yields similar audio quality at a faster speed.

## Training

We use the `accelerate` package from Hugging Face for multi-GPU training. Run `accelerate config` to setup your run configuration. The default accelerate config is in the `configs` folder. Please specify the path to your training files in the `configs/tangoflux_config.yaml`. Samples of `train.json` and `val.json` have been provided. Replace them with your own audio.

`tangoflux_config.yaml` defines the training file paths and model hyperparameters:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 accelerate launch --config_file='configs/accelerator_config.yaml' tangoflux/train.py   --checkpointing_steps="best" --save_every=5 --config='configs/tangoflux_config.yaml'
```

To perform DPO training, modify the training files such that each data point contains "chosen", "reject", "caption" and "duration" fields. Please specify the path to your training files in `configs/tangoflux_config.yaml`. An example has been provided in `train_dpo.json`. Replace it with your own audio.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 accelerate launch --config_file='configs/accelerator_config.yaml' tangoflux/train_dpo.py   --checkpointing_steps="best" --save_every=5 --config='configs/tangoflux_config.yaml'
```

## Evaluation

### TangoFlux vs. Other Audio Generation Models

This key comparison metrics include:

- **Output Length**: Represents the duration of the generated audio.
- **FD**<sub>openl3</sub>: Fréchet Distance.
- **KL**<sub>passt</sub>: KL divergence.
- **CLAP**<sub>score</sub>: Alignment score.


All the inference times are observed on the same A40 GPU. The counts of trainable parameters are reported in the **\#Params** column.

| Model | Params | Duration | Steps | FD<sub>openl3</sub> ↓ | KL<sub>passt</sub> ↓ | CLAP<sub>score</sub> ↑ | IS ↑ | Inference Time (s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AudioLDM 2 (Large)** | 712M | 10 sec | 200 | 108.3 | 1.81 | 0.419 | 7.9 | 24.8 |
| **Stable Audio Open** | 1056M | 47 sec | 100 | 89.2 | 2.58 | 0.291 | 9.9 | 8.6 |
| **Tango 2** | 866M | 10 sec | 200 | 108.4 | 1.11 | 0.447 | 9.0 | 22.8 |
| **TangoFlux (Base)** | 515M | 30 sec | 50 | 80.2 | 1.22 | 0.431 | 11.7 | 3.7 |
| **TangoFlux** | 515M | 30 sec | 50 | 75.1 | 1.15 | 0.480 | 12.2 | 3.7 |

## CRPO dataset generation

There are 2  py files for CRPO dataset generation.
tangoflux/generate_crpo.py generates the crpo dataset by providing path to prompt bank and model weights. You can specify the sample size as well as number of samples per prompt for crpo in the arguments.
tangoflux/label_crpo.py labels the generated audio and construct preference pairs. This will also create a train.json in the output dir that can be passed into train_dpo.py

You can follow the example in crpo.sh which will generate crpo dataset, then perform reward labelling to generate the train.json

To run CRPO for multiple iteration, you can simply repeat the above the process multiple time through setting the correct model weight.
